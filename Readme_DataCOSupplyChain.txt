The purpose of this project was to learn "How to gain insight from BigData using
powerful BI tools"
Here I used Tableau as the Bussiness analystics tools.
At many instances I took help from different open source repository such as
github and StackoverFlow.
Later the model is trained(Decision Tree) and evalute on different mathematical model such as R2
and Confusion Matrix.
Exploratory data analysis is done to gain more insight of the feature present inside dataset.
